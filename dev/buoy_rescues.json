At 12h05, Thursday, 28th December, NSRI Wilderness duty crew were activated following eye-witness reports of a drowning in progress in the sea in front of the Wilderness Hotel. An NSRI sea rescue craft was in the process of being launched and lifeguards were also activated by NSRI to respond directly to the scene using their quad bike \u2013 approximately 3 kilometers from their station. When lifeguards arrived on the scene, they confirmed that a 16-year old was successfully rescued from the water by a member of the public who had used an NSRI Pink Rescue Flotation Buoy that is stationed at the foot of the stairs to the beach. Lifeguards waded into the surf to assist the bystander with the casualty that he had just rescued to get out of the water the last few meters. The teenager was not injured.WC Government Health EMS and George Fire and Rescue Services responded and ER24 were also activated by NSRI to respond. WC Government Health EMS paramedics medically checked on the teenager who was released after being declared medically fit by the EMS paramedics and he required no further assistance. NSRI spoke to and commended the bystander rescuer, Mr. Johan Lamprecht, from Strand, Cape Town, who had noticed the teenager in trouble in the surf and he had grabbed the NSRI pink rescue flotation buoy and using the information on the board his family members raised the alarm while he jumped into the surf with the rescue buoy. He was able to reach the teenager and get him safely to the beach as lifeguards were arriving, followed by NSRI and by the emergency services. In eye-witness Claudine\u2019s own words: \u201cThe Pink Buoy was a life saver, it definitely helped to save a life\u201d. NSRI commend Mr. Lamprecht and his family members for their quick actions in grabbing the Buoy, and the family members who used the information on the NSRI board to raise the alarm. Multiple eye-witnesses had also called NSRI Wilderness to raise the alarm and we wish to take this opportunity to thank the callers for their concern and quick actions. As part of the NSRI\u2019s National Drowning Prevention Drive, NSRI and Lifesaving lifeguards enjoy a close working relationship and the Wilderness lifeguards were able to get to the scene quickly on their quad bike from the Lifeguard Protected Beach which is 2.8 kilometers from the incident. NSRI commend this efficient close working relationship and the quick response by the Wilderness lifeguards.","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":null,"Link ":"http:\/\/mailchi.mp\/searescue\/sea-rescue-wilderness-5mpbxiq3wc?e=29152ef968","Rescuer Details":"Johan Lambrecht, 46","Name of Rescuer with NSRI\/Lifeguarding experience":"Johan Lambrecht","Capacity":"Ex Lifeguard","Rescued details":"Kavish Narshi (16)","Black":null,"White":null,"Coloured":null,"Indian":1.0,"Foreign":null,"Unknown":null,"Unnamed: 31":null,"Unnamed: 32":null,"Unnamed: 33":null,"Unnamed: 34":null,"Unnamed: 35":null,"Unnamed: 36":null,"Unnamed: 37":null,"Unnamed: 38":null,"Unnamed: 39":"NSRI Volunteer"},{"Unnamed: 1":2018,"Date":"2018-01-05T00:00:00.000","Month":"Jan","Number of people assisted":1.0,"Adult":null,"Child":1.0,"Female":1.0,"Male":null,"Number of Victims who needed PRB":1.0,"Number of rescuers who needed PRB":null,"# of  Persons in trouble -  Pink buoy deployed but not used ":null,"Max number of persons floated":null,"PRB location number":"37-LP6","Place":"Jefferies Bay - The Point ","City":"Jeffreys Bay","Sponsor":null,"Rescue ":"Young girl rescued ","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":"http:\/\/nsri.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Rieghard.mp3.mp3 ","Link ":"http:\/\/www.nsri.org.za\/2018\/01\/torpedo-buoy-used-to-assist-young-girl-at-the-point-beach\/","Rescuer Details":"Ask Reighard - st 37","Name of Rescuer with NSRI\/Lifeguarding experience":null,"Capacity":null,"Rescued details":null,"Black":null,"White":null,"Coloured":null,"Indian":null,"Foreign":null,"Unknown":1.0,"Unnamed: 31":null,"Unnamed: 32":null,"Unnamed: 33":null,"Unnamed: 34":null,"Unnamed: 35":null,"Unnamed: 36":null,"Unnamed: 37":null,"Unnamed: 38":null,"Unnamed: 39":"Lifeguard"},{"Unnamed: 1":2018,"Date":"2018-01-07T00:00:00.000","Month":"Jan","Number of people assisted":2.0,"Adult":null,"Child":2.0,"Female":null,"Male":null,"Number of Victims who needed PRB":2.0,"Number of rescuers who needed PRB":null,"# of  Persons in trouble -  Pink buoy deployed but not used ":null,"Max number of persons floated":null,"PRB location number":"11-PA4","Place":"Port Alfred, West Beach  ","City":"Port Alfred","Sponsor":null,"Rescue ":"NSRI have been informed that a Pink Rescue Floatation buoy has been used by a bystander to rescue 2 children from drowning at West Beach, Port Alfred.Details are scarce but eye-witnesses have confirmed that an adult man grabbed the buoy off the pole at West Beach and used the buoy to successfully rescue 2 children.

A father, his daughter and son were surfing in the shore break in front of me. The dad moved outside of me and was trying to catch a wave which I doubted would happen - he never had fins on and the waves were feathering on the outside and reforming for the shore break close in to the beach. To cut a long story short I saw that he was potentially getting himself into an uncomfortable situation so shadowed him from closer in as he drifted down the beach. It wasn't long before the rip got him and he tried in vain to paddle into waves. After repeatedly shouting to him if he was okay he confirmed that he was not in control. I got out the water and ran up the beach to fetch one of the new pink NSRI flotation devices from the pole and asked some one to call the NSRI - I ran back down the beach , asked his daughter, and son to sit on the beach and keep my camera and housing so that I could fetch their dad. Another chap (the one I asked to call the NSRI) with fins and a handsurfing board came down to help me in the fading light. We managed to get him out and back to the beach just as the NSRI arrived. Their response time was really good Lesson to be learnt: Look after those pink devices on the poles- it might be you who is in need of it one day ( I saw a clip where some young guys stole one in J Bay). Be aware of the rips - they are unpredictable and take you so quickly ( been there done that). Keep an eye out for other water users - Make sure you have observed the water before just going out - as benign as Melkbos beach seems- those rips can get heavy quickly.  Don't venture out of your comfort zone.  If you get into trouble try and wave to people to signal as such ( This chap didn't). Dont fight the rip - we panic and forget this but there is an exit point at a rip - I was trying to tell him to paddle sideways , instead he kept trying to paddle straight back into it - I also observed two young girls, maybe 4 years old playing in knee deep water earlier in the day - there was quite a push and the one girl was knocked off her feet and washed up the sand. The mother\/ parents were sitting way up on the grass bank chatting. These incidents happen so quickly - caution is the watch word. As I walked back up the beach before taking this image , I watched as the emotional kids went to their dad as he left the water - I am so glad it was emotion of relief..not other.","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":"Further details in the Station Report, names were not captured.

Two of the men had reportedly gone after the 3rd man, who was originally caught in rip currents, to try to assist him but then they were all caught in rip currents. The caller who raised the alarm, Jessica Barnard, from George, confirmed that her husband, Seth Barnard (32), and her father in-law, Abraham Vos (58), had both gone into the surf to swim out to try assist the three men. Mr Barnard had run up the beach to grab the NSRI pink rescue flotation buoy (that is positioned at the entrance to beach) and to also fetch their two body boards. He and Mr Vos entered the water with the NSRI pink rescue flotation buoy and the 2 body boards. NSRI Wilderness rescue crew were responding directly to the scene while additional NSRI crew members were preparing the sea rescue craft Clement Gold Rescuer and our NSRI rescue vehicle to tow the sea rescue craft to the scene. Mr Barnard and Mr Vos were able to reach two of the casualties who had been pulled out into deep surf towards the end of the Bay.  The 3rd casualty had been separated from the other 2 men and he had managed to swim back to shore unassisted.

The sea rescue craft Rescue Free Runner and a Side by Side was launched and our rescue vehicle responded. On arrival on the scene the Johannesburg 15 year old male had been rescued by local Good Samaritan Brian Bailey using an NSRI Pink Rescue Buoy. The teenager, Samora Tembe, 15, of Johannesburg, family friend's of the Berman's from Cape Town, was not injured and he required no further assistance. NSRI medics checked on Samora and he was fine and in good spirits. Saul Berman of Cape Town, Leah's dad, an avid supporter of NSRI for many years and more recently an avid supporter of our Pink Rescue Buoy program specifically asked NSRI Plettenberg Bay, some time ago, to place an NSRI Pink Rescue Buoy on the beach in front of his house at Robberg 5 due to the frequency of incidents at that beach where a rip current prevails. Saul, having sponsored a number of NSRI Pink Rescue Buoys, we complied without hesitation, said Marc Rodgers, NSRI Plettenberg Bay station commander. While swimming Samora got into trouble in the surf, he was caught in a rip current, Leah raised the alarm calling NSRI on her cellphone. Samora was caught in the current and trying to swim against the current. We later determined, although he is a strong swimmer he was unaware of the rip current and not aware to swim across the beach to free himself from the current. A life lesson he learnt today admitted the teenager with a broad smile. Leah saw a male jogger on the beach, local Brian Bailey, she was wading in shallow water and requested the assistance of the jogger pointing out Samora struggling in the surf, her brother Zack ran to fetch the pink buoy off the board while Brian stripped off his jogging gear and with the Pink buoy in his hand he launched into the surf and while wading through the surf towards the teenager he shouted at him to move sideways to free himself from the rip but the teenager still made no progress but then he popped onto the sand bank and was finally safe and Brian waded with the teenager to shore to safety.NSRI commend the efforts of these Good Samaritans involved, the Berman's of Cape Town and Brian Bailey. NSRI are delighted that this is now our 32nd successful rescue from the Pink rescue buoy program. Requested by Ross Badenhorst, deputy station commander of NSRI Plettenberg Bay, to recount his story, these are Good Samaritan Brian Bailey's own words...\n\"Hi Ross. No problem. I was on a run and about to finish - that\u2019s my exit from the beach, Robberg 5. I noticed a girl wading in the shallows in the rip (Leah Berman), and on her indication then realised that there was a swimmer at the 3rd wave set but in the middle of the rip. I stopped running and watched him. He was reasonably comfortable but swimming directly back to the beach, against the rip.\nI waved to him and motioned he should swim to the left- which he did. He then started tiring and losing ground to the rip. I asked the kid (Zack Berman) to run and get the pink buoy for me and stripped down to enter the water. I also asked the bystanders to call NSRI. At this stage the swimmer was trying to swim back stroke and clearly exhausted so I knew I had to go in. Armed with the pink buoy I waved to him to go right and ran in along the sand bank adjacent to the rip. He started moving towards the rendezvous point and I was about belly button deep when he popped onto the sandbank 15 meters to my left. We waded back together and I asked him how he was, he was tired but happy. I commended him on moving sideways out the rip ascertained that he was ok and hadn\u2019t taken on too much water. Saul Berman (Zack and Leah's father) came down from the house and thanked me. I took the buoy back to the sign board and reattached it in its place and then went to the waters edge to clean up, put my shoes on and I continued on my run. That\u2019s when I noticed you guys coming along the beach. Without the Pink buoy I admit I wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to go in. It\u2019s an amazing aid and you should be proud for supplying them, said Brian.\u00a0","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":"Teenager.

Knowing that these kids have a tendency to get themselves in trouble, from previous experiences when I lived and worked as a lifeguard in the bay, I kept an eye on them.\nThey started swimming and were in a safe spot until the tide came up further causing the right side channel to fill and start pulling. The children were waist deep and bodysurfing the smaller waves in the shallow water - this is when a larger set came in and washed them immediately into the right channel.\n\nI knew then that I would have to go help the 3 boys that were now in trouble.\n\nFrom previous experiences I knew that this was going to be difficult as they were 3 boys and had split into a group of 2 and 1. I started to put on my wetsuit, I have been involved with rescues that have taken a very long time in Herolds bay where the boat has only arrived an hour plus later and I know that the cold will get you if you are not careful.\n\nAs I was changing I asked two people to please start spotting the boys and explained to give me hand signals to guide me onto the 3rd child if he was to go under. This is when I first noticed Cliff walking towards the water with the new pink buoys that have been posted along the coast. At first I screamed to stop him from going in as he had no swim fins and looked unsure - he was looking around for assistance. He did not hear my call but I do believe that his actions saved the boys that day. \n\nAs I was putting on my leash for my bodyboard and running down to the water he had already entered and had used the rip to get to the first two boys. When I entered the water I made a conscious decision to now go for the group of 3 (including Cliff) first as I knew that I would probably have lost the 3rd child by the time I got to him. When I got to the first group Cliff seemed to have control and I told him that I was going to get the third child and be back for them, he agreed and I proceeded deeper into the channel were I got the final glimpse of the boy as he went under. \n\nAs I reached his position I saw him under the water but lifted by the swell and dived in I was able to grab him first attempt. As we surfaced he coughed and spluttered some water out and was generally okay but naturally tired.\n\nI then placed him on my board and started to make my way to the first party that had drifted closer towards us. Cliff then introduced himself to me and we started to make a plan. I informed him that we had 3 options 1)swim deeper and wait for a boat 2) swim out on the rocks or 3) swim out and left into the surf and hopefully get washed back in. We went for the third option which seemed the least painful as the backline was looking especially heavy that afternoon and washing up in a particular rocky gully had never been fun in previous rescues. I was also sure it would work as we had the pushing tide on our side which I think helped us that afternoon. \n\nAs we started to slowly work our way over I noticed another boy swim in with another pink buoy, I asked if he had swim fins or any experience of life saving or Herolds bay which all answers were a \"no\". I told Cliff at this point I had to take at least two kids in and then return for the last three as the party was getting too big and one of the boys was starting to panic. Cliff agreed and continued to swim with the remaining two boys as I returned the new boy and the one of the original boys. Once they were safely ashore I returned to the last two boys and Cliff who had made great progress in getting back to shore. At this point there was a local surfer, Cliff and myself to get in the remainder of the way and we were out in no time. As we reached shore Cliff then proceeded with first aid and was then joined from all the emergency crew who got there in no time at all, I'm still amazed at the rapid response today.\n\nAll in all this was not my first time in that situation and was fully aware of what was needed that afternoon. I think the people that deserve the recognition that day are Cliff and the three boys. Cliff informed me in the water that 3 days prior he had a hernia operation, and he still responded. Without his selfless response we would have, without a doubt, lost the third boy. Secondly, the boys did an amazing job listening, assisting and staying calm, without this the outcome could have been different and would have made for difficult reading.\n\nIf there is anything else you need please give me a shout.\n\nThanks\nSyd\n\n\n\nSydney Erasmus\n \nM: 07714506821\nW: fabulousrigging.co.uk\nE:  sydney@fabrigging.co.uk\n","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":"Two teenagers swimming saw a third child caught in a rip and tried to assist, but one the original two also got caught and his friend then tried to assist him.

He was driving down the hill when he saw a flash of pink on the beach - he was not thinking rescue and when he played this back in his mind he thought that it was someone in a bright costume. \n\nHe then got a call from one of his coast watchers, Gerlinde Kerling, who told him that children had taken a Pink Buoy off its pole and were running to the sea playing with it. He knew that they must be locals because the holiday makers had all left Oyster Bay and thought that it was unlikely that local children would play with a Pink Rescue Buoy because of the educational drives that he and the Oyster Bay volunteers has been doing. \n\nLodewyk decided to go to the beach to check what was happening. As he got there Ricardo Kettledas, who he knows as a weak swimmer was exiting the water with a youngster who was unconscious. As Lodewyk was helping get the child out of the water he heard that there was another child out at the backline. Having activated a call out for Stn 36, and knowing that the volunteers were responding Lodewyk put the first child into the recovery position, kicked his boots off and entered the rip current, as this was most likely where he would find the child. \n\nRicardo followed him with the Pink Rescue Buoy. About 100 meters out in approximately three meters of water Lodewyk spotted the child under water at about 2 meters. He dived down and pulled the boy to the surface. Lodewyk and Ricardo used the Pink Rescue Buoy to keep themselves and the unconscious boy afloat. Lodewyk, assisted by Ricardo, swam the boy out of the rip and onto a sandbank where they could stand. They then waded the boy out of the water onto the beach where Lodewyk started CPR on him. The boy had been in the water for approximately 15 minutes and Lodewyk had little hope of a successful outcome. After doing CPR for around 12 minutes he once again did his vital checks and realised that the child was breathing shallowly and had a pulse.\n\nThe two boys were transported to hospital in a critical condition by Private Care Ambulance. Lodewyk met the two boys after their release from hospital 5 days after the incident and was thrilled that both went off to start their Grade 8 school year seven days after their ordeal.

The bystander had shouted at the youngster to rather rest and use the Pink Rescue Buoy to float him knowing that Sea Rescue had been called and that Tristin was fetching his fins.\n\nTristin jumped off the rocks into the sea and using the rip he was quickly able to reach the teenager.\n\nTristin calmed him down and using the Pink Rescue Buoy for floatation, aided by his fins he swam the teenager towards the middle of Herolds Bay until they were free of the rip current and could then use the waves to get back to the beach.\n\nTristin says that if the youngster did not have the Pink Rescue Buoy to hold onto he would have drowned.\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nGarth Dominy, NSRI Wilderness station commander, said: At 15h53, Tuesday, 25 August, NSRI Wilderness duty crew were activated following reports of a teenager being swept out to sea at Herolds Bay.\n\nOur duty crew responded to our sea rescue station and the sea rescue craft Clemengold Rescuer was launched.\n\nNSRI rescue swimmers, WC Government Health EMS rescue squad, the SA Police Services, Frontier Medix medical services and Eden 911 ambulance services responded directly to the scene.\n\nOn arrival on the scene NSRI rescue swimmers found a local lifeguard, Tristin de Swardt, age 20, who was assisting a local 16 year old male out of the water and bringing the casualty teenager onto the beach.\n\nOur sea rescue craft also arrived on the scene as casualty teenager was brought onto the beach.\n\nThe teenager was medically assessed and found to be suffering suspected non-fatal drowning symptoms.\n\nA doctor, who happened to be on the beach at the time, assisted in medical care on the scene and NSRI have thanked her for her assistance on the scene.\n\nThe patient was taken into the care of paramedics and he has been transported to hospital, as a precaution for observation for non-fatal drowning symptoms, in an Eden 911 ambulance and the patient is in a stable condition.\n\nThe local lifeguard who assisted, Tristin de Swardt, has told NSRI that he happened to be on the beach when he noticed a group of 6 teenagers, aged approximately 16, who had arrived at the beach and they appeared to be preparing to jump off rocks into the sea on the Eastern side of Herolds Bay.\n\nTristin approached them and asked them if they were competent swimmers as the sea conditions were confused seas with a 2 to 2.5 meter swell with strong rip currents evident.\n\nThey told Tristin that they were competent.\n\nThe first teenager who jumped into the water was immediately caught in a rip current and he was swept out to sea.\n\nHis friends did not follow him.\n\nBystanders raised the alarm.\n\nTristin attempted to swim out to the teenager but the currents were too strong and Tristin realised that he needed his swimming rescue flippers if he was going to swim out to the teenager.\n\nTristin swam back to the shore and he got his rescue flippers out of his car and ran back to the rocks where bystanders had by that stage grabbed the NSRI pink rescue buoy off the pole nearby and they had thrown the rescue buoy to the teenager who was able to get a hold of the rescue buoy but he was still caught in rip currents and he was still being swept further out to sea.\n\nTristin jumped off the rocks into the sea and he swam after the teenager and he was able to reach the teenager.\n\nTristin calmed the teenager down and with the teenager using the pink rescue buoy for floatation and with Tristin aided by the strength of his rescue flippers Tristan assisted the teenager to swim towards the middle of Herolds Bay until they were free of the rip currents.\n\nThen with the teenager still using the aid of the pink rescue buoy for floatation and Tristin using his rescue flippers for swimming strength Tristin swam the teenager to shore safely.\n\nNSRI commend Tristin for his efforts in saving the teenagers life today.\n\nNSRI also commend the bystanders who threw the NSRI pink rescue buoy to the teenager that contributed to saving the teenagers life.","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":null,"Link ":"https:\/\/www.nsri.org.za\/2020\/08\/herolds-bay-lifeguard-saves-teen-with-the-aid-of-a-pink-rescue-buoy\/","Rescuer Details":"Tristin de Swardt, 20, cell 082 526 7978","Name of Rescuer with NSRI\/Lifeguarding experience":null,"Capacity":null,"Rescued details":"unknown male approximately 16 years of age.","Black":null,"White":null,"Coloured":null,"Indian":null,"Foreign":null,"Unknown":1.0,"Unnamed: 31":null,"Unnamed: 32":null,"Unnamed: 33":null,"Unnamed: 34":null,"Unnamed: 35":null,"Unnamed: 36":null,"Unnamed: 37":null,"Unnamed: 38":null,"Unnamed: 39":null},{"Unnamed: 1":2020,"Date":"2020-09-23T00:00:00.000","Month":"Sept","Number of people assisted":1.0,"Adult":1.0,"Child":null,"Female":null,"Male":1.0,"Number of Victims who needed PRB":1.0,"Number of rescuers who needed PRB":null,"# of  Persons in trouble -

On scene the RS confirmed that there were 2 casualties both male, 1 with hypothermia and the other with deep cuts and abrasions on his legs, knees and thighs.

Once both vessels were alongside, Geoff Stephens and I discussed that first prize would be to float the casualties out due to the condition of the hypothermia casualty. \nThe plan was to extricate both casualties via the sea using the 6inch \u201ccrocoduck\u201d. A 3rd RS was put onto rescue 2, while both casualties were briefed and prepared for the extrication. The 3rd RS with the crocoduck were deployed to scene where the extrication of the hypothermic casualty was commenced. Once loaded onto the crocoduck the casualty was extricated and transferred from the \u201ccrocoduck\u201d \/R2 onto Rescue 8 for further treatment, this was the case for the next casualty as well. \nBoth casualties were then taken to Rescue 8 Base by Rescue 8 followed by 8A \u2013 R2 departed after the operation was complete.

We were at the beach around 09:30 about the time of the change of the tide and the sea was quite mixed up. \n \nOn our way onto the beach I noted the pink bouy and thought to myself that I am grateful that it is in place on the beach. \n \nThere was another group of probably 2 families with some young adults - young, fit people, likely students enjoying swimming in the sea - there were also what seemed like 2 older couples.\n \nAround 10:00 we were standing on the dune with the 2 boys playing in the sand discussing how the sea is all mixed up when I noted that one of the girls was floating on her back in the mixed up surf & I thought to myself she seems to be very relaxed & comfortable. It doesn't D not seem like she was in trouble, it seemed like she was simply floating at the same place - not like she's being pulled into the sea...\n \nThe next moment I noted that one of the older men came running past us with the pink bouy in hand. I tried to see where tge person who is in trouble could be when I realized that the girl that was floating all relaxed was the one in distress. When she was reached by the man with the bouy I could see that he also had trouble to be able to swim out with the girl.  Two of the other men in their group formed a human chain to reach them and help them out to solid ground. \n \nThe girl and one of the older ladies held each other in an emotional hug and it really touched me to realize that we've just witnessed the rescue of the girl by the use of the NSRI Pink Bouy.\n \nThank you so much for the great work you do to make these boys available to enable people to assist people when someone is in distress. \n \nRegards \n \nJan Venter ","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Difficulty Swimming ","Additional ":"Email from witness Jan Venter","Link ":null,"Rescuer Details":null,"Name of Rescuer with NSRI\/Lifeguarding experience":null,"Capacity":null,"Rescued details":null,"Black":null,"White":null,"Coloured":null,"Indian":null,"Foreign":null,"Unknown":1.0,"Unnamed: 31":null,"Unnamed: 32":null,"Unnamed: 33":null,"Unnamed: 34":null,"Unnamed: 35":null,"Unnamed: 36":null,"Unnamed: 37":null,"Unnamed: 38":null,"Unnamed: 39":null},{"Unnamed: 1":2021,"Date":"2021-12-25T00:00:00.000","Month":"Dec","Number of people assisted":1.0,"Adult":1.0,"Child":null,"Female":null,"Male":1.0,"Number of Victims who needed PRB":1.0,"Number of rescuers who needed PRB":null,"# of  Persons in trouble -  Pink buoy deployed but not used ":null,"Max number of persons floated":null,"PRB location number":"11-PA8 or 9","Place":"Cannon Rocks","City":"Cannon Rocks","Sponsor":null,"Rescue ":"Here\u2019s to the NSRi pink life saving torpedo bouys \nChristmas Day 2021 , I got a call from a mate down the road on the beachfront of cannon rocks swimming bay, \u201c have I got eyes on the ocean? \u201c immediately I ran to our front lawn and saw two guys 400m far off the back line, knocked off their paddle skis and caught in a very strong rip offshore , beyond large 2.5 to  3 m  south east pitching waves in an erratic tumultuous sea. Realising the urgency, I asked my wife, Tess,   to rush to my Landy and get me my long carbon spear fishing fins. I then asked ngoni, a visitor from Zim who never knew the ocean , to rush to the bay and get me the buoy and meet me in front of our house at the waters edge. Realising the ocean was 15 deg , I donned my full length suit, put on swimming goggles in case I needed to dive down and find the body, I raced down to the waters edge. Ngoni had pulled the whole support pole out and raced to meet me at the beach with seconds to spare. Moments later , I took a line to swim out using the currents and got to the two guys. A local surfer and mate called Andre, strongly paddled out and took the stronger brother back to shore after a long hard paddle. I took the weaker victim who was on the verge of loosing it , to the back line. The buoy enabled be to fin on my back pulling hard , putting distance between us , whilst I could watch him and talk to him to keep him conscious. I felt that once we could get into the pounding surf zone we could better use the waves to reach the shore. The whole event took the best of a 30 min hard swim which then entailed a 2 hr stabilisation on the beach treating for hypothermia and severe fatigue.

He is Struan Jamieson and this is the story:\nA group of cold water swimmers including Sarah Oberholzer and Jonathan Smuts were about 75 meters off 4th beach when Sarah noticed that one of the group, a young man who had recently moved to Cape Town from Pretoria was unresponsive. She asked him if he was ok and got no answer \u2026 although he was still swimming. She realised that he needed help. She waved and shouted which prompted Struan Jamieson and Jason Fialkov who were on the beach to swim out to help her and Jonathan. \nHaving two weeks previously rescued a woman who was washed out of the Saunders Rocks tidal pool, and really struggled with that rescue as he did not have any flotation, Struan decided to first run up the beach and fetch the Pink Buoy which he knew would help him and the man in difficulty.\nStruan and Jason swam out through big surf with the Pink Buoy which the hypothermic young man gratefully took hold of.\n\u201cThe conditions were hectic and there was a strong rip,\u201d said Jason, who in his youth was a Clifton Lifeguard. \u201cWe had to fight the rip which was pulling us towards the rocks and he was so heavy,\u201d agreed Struan. The four rescuers managed to get the young man safely onto the beach and tried to warm him up knowing that an ambulance was on the way.\nThe young man was taken to hospital and kept overnight with non-fatal drowning symptoms. He was released today (Saturday 5 February) and is absolutely fine after his ordeal.\nThis is the 99th successful rescue in which a Pink Rescue Buoy has been used to save a life. All rescues that have been attempted with a Pink Rescue Buoy have been successful and no harm has come to any rescuers.\nContact details:\nYoung woman who called for help:\nSarah Oberholzer cell 079 501 1759 email sjpost08@gmail.com\nJonathan Smuts \u2026\n\nYoung man who swam out with PRB:\nStruan Jamieson 082 557 5825\nJason Fialkov 082 882 5575\n\n\nRescued man:\nMardus Strydom 082 557 5825\n","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Hypothermia","Additional ":null,"Link ":null,"Rescuer Details":"Young woman who called for help:\nSarah Oberholzer cell 079 501 1759 email sjpost08@gmail.com\n\nPerson who swam out with the pink buoy\nStruan Jamieson 082 557 5825\nAssisted by Jason Fialkov 082 882 5575\n","Name of Rescuer with NSRI\/Lifeguarding experience":"Struan Jamieson","Capacity":"Ex Lifeguard","Rescued details":"Mardus Strydom 082 557 5825","Black":null,"White":1.0,"Coloured":null,"Indian":null,"Foreign":null,"Unknown":null,"Unnamed: 31":null,"Unnamed: 32":null,"Unnamed: 33":null,"Unnamed: 34":null,"Unnamed: 35":null,"Unnamed: 36":null,"Unnamed: 37":null,"Unnamed: 38":null,"Unnamed: 39":null},{"Unnamed: 1":2022,"Date":"2022-12-02T00:00:00.000","Month":"Feb","Number of people assisted":1.0,"Adult":1.0,"Child":null,"Female":1.0,"Male":null,"Number of Victims who needed PRB":1.0,"Number of rescuers who needed PRB":null,"# of  Persons in trouble -  Pink buoy deployed but not used ":null,"Max number of persons floated":null,"PRB location number":"18-27","Place":"Sunset Beach","City":"Cape Town","Sponsor":"Ocean Basket","Rescue ":"Sunset beach 14h50 \nWitnesses:\nColleen Lemmetjies  064 465 9055\nTerri Lemmetjies 072 576 8997\nChrystal Filander, 45, was rescued by two unknown men (one coloured one white in their 30s) using a Pink Buoy 18 -27 sponsored by Ocean Basket.\nColleen and Chrystal swimming together, wave knocked them off their feet and Chrystal pulled out by a rip current.

He launched into the rip heading for the closest two people - a man (who had given his board to the one woman) and the other woman - neither of whom who now had flotation.\n\nWhile Reagan was suiting up a surfer had paddled out and put one woman, who was struggling the most, on his board. He left her to help the other woman who had no flotation.\n\nThe woman on the board was pulled further out in rip and the man who\u2019s board it was stayed with the other woman, trapped in the rip next to the rocks and unable to get out. Reagan paddled to them and using his board as flotation managed to pull the man (who had given his board to the one woman) and the woman out by using a wave and paddling them out and onto the rocks. Heidi\u2019s board was not damaged in this manoeuvre.\n\nMeanwhile Heidi had given a Pink Buoy to another bystander (no name) who then swam out to the woman on the surfboard. She had now been pulled out towards the surf spot known as Battleships in front of the Scarborough parking lot.\n\nReagan launched off the rocks on Heidi\u2019s board for the second time and paddled out to the two. He helped the woman to better position herself on the board and told her to hold onto his leash after calming her down. The man with the Pink Buoy held on to the back of the board and Reagan paddled them out of the rip into the middle of Scarborough beach where he could use the waves over the sandbank to get the two onto the beach. \n\nIt was a long paddle out of the rip and against an offshore cross wind.\n\nBy the time Reagan got the two into the shallows there were a number of bystanders to help get the man with the Pink Buoy and the woman onto the sand.\n\nReagan said that it was their plan to surf Witsand that day and it was Heidi that said she would prefer to go to Scarborough - a decision that saved two lives.","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":null,"Link ":null,"Rescuer Details":"Reagan Smith","Name of Rescuer with NSRI\/Lifeguarding experience":null,"Capacity":null,"Rescued details":"Unknown","Black":null,"White":null,"Coloured":null,"Indian":null,"Foreign":null,"Unknown":1.0,"Unnamed: 31":null,"Unnamed: 32":null,"Unnamed: 33":null,"Unnamed: 34":null,"Unnamed: 35":null,"Unnamed: 36":null,"Unnamed: 37":null,"Unnamed: 38":null,"Unnamed: 39":null},{"Unnamed: 1":2022,"Date":"2022-02-24T00:00:00.000","Month":"Feb","Number of people assisted":1.0,"Adult":1.0,"Child":null,"Female":null,"Male":1.0,"Number of Victims who needed PRB":1.0,"Number of rescuers who needed PRB":null,"# of  Persons in trouble -  Pink buoy deployed but not used ":null,"Max number of persons floated":null,"PRB location number":"23-63","Place":"Wilderness Main Beach","City":"Wilderness","Sponsor":"FEM","Rescue ":"A German citizen, name unknown  took the PRB in front of Stn 23, main beach Wilderness to help a Swiss man who was pulled out 200 m by a rip.

The manager ran onto West Pier and he was able to throw the pink rescue buoy to the casualty who was able to grab a hold of the pink rescue buoy while he was being battered by waves in the surf line.\n\nOur NSRI duty crew responded to our NSRI Port Alfred rescue station to launch sea rescue craft.\nGardmed ambulance services were activated.\n\nAn off duty NSRI trainee rescue swimmer, who was nearby at the time, saw the commotion and he ran along West Pier, stripped down to his under clothes and he jumped into the river to go to the assistance of the man.\nBut when he reached the man, about 50 meters into the river from West Pier, he found only the NSRI pink rescue buoy afloat with no sign of the man who had by now slipped under water.\n\nThe NSRI trainee rescue swimmer pulled on the rope and leash, that is attached to the pink rescue buoy, and to his surprise he could feel resistance so he continued to pull on the rope and leash when the leg of the man appeared from under water and it was obvious that the rope had somehow remarkably tangled itself around the man's leg.\n\nHe was able to get the man's head above water but the man was not breathing.\n\nAt that stage our NSRI rescue craft, Rescue 11 Alpha, had arrived on the scene and we pulled them onto our rescue craft. We initiated medical treatment and brought the man to our NSRI rescue station.\n\nThe man had started spontaneous breathing and he was expelling water from his lungs.\n\nNSRI medics continued with oxygen therapy and handed the man into the care of Gardmed paramedics who transported the man to hospital in a serious condition by ambulance.\n\nThe man, believed to be aged in his early 20's, is recovering in hospital in the care of hospital staff and he remains unidentified.\n\nAnyone with information pertaining to the identity of the man can call Port Alfred Police on\n046 624 1583 or Port Alfred Hospital046 604 4000 or NSRI EOC (Emergency Operations Centre) 0870949774.\n\nNSRI commend the swift reaction of all involved in the successful rescue, in particular the manager of Guido's restaurant, Irvin Arendse, for his assistance with the NSRI pink rescue buoy that contributed to saving the man's life.\n\nThis is the third life saved by that same NSRI pink rescue buoy stationed on-duty at West Beach and the 122nd recorded life saved by the contribution of an NSRI pink rescue buoy.","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Washed off pier","Additional ":"Whatsapps from Keryn to Andrew","Link ":null,"Rescuer Details":"Irvin Arendse.

The family were reported to be safely out of the water and they required no further assistance.\n\nEdward Gutsche, 46, a friend of NSRI Port Alfred station commander Juan Pretorius, Ed is a local man who owns a financial company and Nick Laws, 64, a British man, in the film industry, who has been living in South Africas for 18 years (Nick's late wife was a Police Air Wing helicopter pilot). \n\nThey recounted to NSRI details of an incident that happened at Kelly's Beach on Saturday.\n\nAt around 09h30, while body boarding at Kelly's Beach Edward kept planning this to be the last wave he would catch for the morning before heading home but somehow he kept riding waves until finally it was his last wave and he had exited the water to head towards his car.\n\nA lady and her daughter came running up to him shouting appeals for him to help them -  their family members were drowning. Edward looked towards where they were frantically indicating, he saw 4 heads bobbing in the water.\n\nEarlier there had been a number of people on the beach but somehow at this moment it was just the 3 of them on the beach and 4 people in serious trouble in the mid break surf line.\n\nThinking it would be only moments before other people arrived at the beach who would no doubt alert NSRI Edward, without hesitation put his flippers on his feet and he launched his body to go to their assistance.\n\nBy the time he reached the first casualty they appeared to have been separated from each other by about 15 to 30 meters each.\n\nHe reached a girl aged about 16. He instructed her to hold onto his body board for floatation and he reassured her he would come back shortly.\n\nHe then reached a male child aged about 12. He instructed the child to obey him and let him take him to the body board. The child obeyed and Ed swam him to the body board. That child kept trying to climb onto the body board, using a stern voice Ed showed the child to hold onto the board so both he and his sister could use the board for flotation. Reassuring them he would be back he went after the next casualty.\n\nHe then reached a female child aged about 14. As he reached her she disappeared under water.\n\nHe dived under water swimming deeper searching for her. He spotted her, she was looking at him. The braids in her hair that he had noticed just before she went under water were floating about her face giving the appearance of an Octopus. She took in a deep breath of water before appearing to be lifeless (or unconscious). Ed grabbed her and pulled her to the surface. Once above water she spluttered, coughed and expired water. To his surprise she was conscious. He reassured her before swimming her back to the body board. He arranged them so that all 3 could use the body board for flotation.\n\nEd then went in search of the dad. Finding him quite a distance away at the back breakers Ed had to be very stern with him. He was trying to use Ed for flotation.\n\nEd managed to calm him down before swimming him to his children.\n\nOnce they were all together Ed arranged them around the body board and started towing them towards the beach.\n\nEd admits he was surprised that no one else had reached them by this stage. No one had raised the alarm.\n\nWhile towing them towards the shore Ed would keep a lookout for incoming waves, warning them of approaching waves, and together they braced themselves around the body board as waves were breaking around them and they all stayed together.\n\nNick Law had taken a swim when he noticed the drama unfolding out in the surf line.\n\nNick grabbed the NSRI pink rescue buoy that is stationed at Kelly's Beach and he launched into the surf reaching them at the mid breakers.\n\nIt appears that the family saw Nick as a lifeguard (because he had the pink buoy with him). Ed has suggested that on Nick arriving at them appeared to have a huge calming effect.\n\nAlthough they admit that the pink was not needed Nick swam alongside them ready to use the pink buoy to assist any of the casualties who may have lost a holding on the body board.\n\nEd's company is the sponsor of that pink rescue buoy at Kelly's Beach.\n\nThey were brought safely to the beach where they were reunited with their 2 family members in an emotional reunion.\n\nThey were all holding onto each other huddled on the beach.\n\nA member of the beach office seemed to be watching them from the beach office but surprisingly NSRI and emergency services had not been called.\n\nNick alerted NSRI to the incident. The 2 men watched over the family on the beach before it was evident they needed no further help and NSRI was not required.\n\nThe dad hugged Ed and expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the intervention.\n\nIt is believed that the family may be from Zimbabwe but NSRI has not managed to trace them. We are hoping they see this report and contact NSRI on 0823803800.\n\nNick, NSRI commend you for going to their aid with the rescue buoy. \n\nEd, NSRI commend you for this incredible effort that saved 4 lives.","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":"Ed Gutsche (46) recoved all four victims with his body board.

The other two rescuers, both believed to be approximately 18 years old, were themselves swept out past the original two children and were now also in difficulty. I'M SURE THAT THE FOUR MANAGED TO RESCUE THE TWO 12-YEAR-OLDS, AND AFTER DOING SO, TWO OF THE FOUR GOT SUCKED OUT, THE OTHER TWO TRIED TO HELP THEM, AND THEN THERE WERE FOUR IN TROUBLE. BY THE TIME I HIT THE WATER ONE WAS EXITING TO MY RIGHT. HE CONFIRMED THAT THERE WERE 3 MORE. I THEN INSTRUCTED ALL BATHERS TO CLEAR THE SEA TO AVOID CONFUSION. ONCE I WAS AT CHEST DEPTH,  A SECOND CASUALTY MADE IT TO THE IMPACT ZONE, AND HE FURTHER CONFIRMED TWO MORE. THIS LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE THE 12-YEAR-OLD KIDS WERE OUT. CREDIT MUST GO TO THE FOUR FOR TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS.\n \nDale Irvine from Cape Town, despite wearing a brace for an ankle injury, grabbed an NSRI Pink Rescue Buoy as well as a bodyboard and ran to the shorefront to assist the casualties. \n \nWhilst on the beach, Dale passed the Pink Rescue Buoy to an off-duty lifeguard, Abi Olivier (17) who handed it to a fellow lifeguard, Abre Pio (26). Abi then stayed on shore to maintain control of the shallows and the beach and help the rescued casualties as they were being brought out of the water. By the time Dale had secured the shallower of the two casualties, Abre had reached them. After a quick assessment of the situation, Abre took responsibility for the deeper of the two and swam on to his rescue. Armed with the Pink Buoy, and swimming strongly, Abre reached the other 18-year-old who was further out to sea and barely conscious by this time after going under at least twice.\n \nShortly after this a bodyboarder Hugo Naude (16) + 1 (I'm trying to get his name) swam past a shoreward-bound Dale, who directed them to Abre's assistance. Upon reaching a manageable depth, Dale handed his casualty to Abi and other members of the public who helped him out of the water. Dale and another off-duty lifeguard from Mossel Bay ( do you have a name? then returned to the surf to offer assistance to Abre, Hugo and + 1lifeguard. \n \nThe casualty was utterly incapacitated and incapable of taking instruction. The bodyboard leash was transferred to the casualty and he was placed on the bodyboard, and then he was effectively \"surfed\" to shore. After reaching shore Abre, Hugo and Xxxx x 2  carried the casualty to the sand, whereupon various members of the medical fraternity attended him.\n \n \nI HACE A MEMORY OF \"JESSICA\" BUT IT'S RESTRICTED TO GIVING HER THE BOUY WITH AN INSTRUCTION TO HAUL A FEW KIDS OUT OF THE SHALLOWS WHO WERE PLAYING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE RIP.

He tried to reassure the distressed boys, encouraging them to keep holding on the body board and kicking together whenever a wave came. \n \nDivan\u2019s wife, Charice (32) had grabbed the Pink Rescue Buoy and was calling for someone to assist her husband and the family from New Zealand.

Divan together with the father and the 10 year old boy were also able to use the body board to get back to shore.  \n \nMeanwhile a group of 4 men, who were working on a building site overlooking the beach had watched the events unfold and also ran down to the beach. One of the workers, a 21-year old man grabbed the Pink Rescue Buoy and entered the water to assist. Unfortunately, the 21-year old was pulled out by the strong current past the casualties, but was able to keep himself afloat. On arriving on the scene, the NSRI rescue swimmer, quickly assessed the situation and given the distance the casualty was from the shore, confirmed that he was entering the water but would need the back-up of a rescue boat. He was also not sure whether there were any other casualties in the water.  \n \nThe NSRI rescue swimmer reached the 21-year-old man who had the pink rescue buoy and was able to swim him back to shore. NSRI medics who had responded to scene were subsequently joined by NSRI crew who had responded by boat and provided emergency treatment to the 10-year-old boy and the 21-year good Samaritan who has swum to assist. The 14-year old boy and his father, also shocked by experience did not require any treatment.   \n \nThe two casualties were handed over to EMS paramedics on scene and after further assessment determined that they would not require treatment in hospital.   \n \nNSRI commend everyone involved in this incident, in particular the Good Samaritans who took the two Pink Rescue Buoys and body board for flotation, they contributes to lives saved.   \n\nEnds.\n\nNotes  \nMetro arrives 1357 \n \nThembela \u2013 contact for Nelson (21) \u2013 swam with PRB.

They had been walking on the beach where they noticed the commotion. Together with other bystanders they had thrown floating objects, including an NSRI pink rescue buoy and body boards, towards the casualty teenagers.\n\nThe girl had been holding onto the pink floatation buoy but exhausted she had lost a hold on the floatation buoy.\n\nThe boy was holding onto a body board but by that stage he had been separated from the girl.\n\nGood Samaritan Simon Bekker, age 66, a former Navy diver, launched into the surf to try to assist. He reached the girl and while assisting her they were separated while trying to reach the shore. He had called on family and bystanders on the shore to throw floating gear towards them. The girl had a pink rescue buoy that she was holding onto.\n\nSimon then went towards the male casualty, who was close to rocks and in grave danger. In strong currents Simon called to the teenager to swim away from the rocks before Simon was forced to retreat and recovered himself to the shoreline.\n\nGood Samaritan 50 year old Jan Bester launched into the surf, wearing flippers that bystanders had passed to him, in efforts to try to assist.\n\nIn strong currents Jan reached the girl who was barely conscious and slipping under water.\nAssisted by the floating objects he was able to swim the girl safely to a beach.\n\nNSRI Oyster Bay's Jaen Smit arrived on the scene where he initiated medical treatment to the girl who was initially unconscious and not breathing.\n\nFollowing airway management and re-warming she regained consciousness and spontaneous breathing while expelling water from her lungs. \n\nJan fetched his Fortuner SUV and she was loaded into his car and driven to meet up with the responding Private Care ambulance. Paramedics took her into their care.\n\nGood Samaritans Fanus Kruger, a local, and his family, his son Pieter and 15 year old grandson Steph, who are visiting from Rustenberg, at home nearby at Skuitbaai, were alerted by Franette Bekker to the unfolding drama.\n\nThey raced down to the Skuitbaai launch site where Pieter and Steph launched a jet-ski. They were approximately a nautical mile from where the incident was unfolding and despite dense fog and rough seas they reached the scene where they initiated a search.\n\nIn the dense fog and rough seas and close to rocks they reached the male teenager who was holding onto a body board. He was showing signs of extreme exhaustion and disappearing under water at times.\n\nOn reaching him Pieter reversed the jet-ski towards him in the breaking surf, keeping the bow of the jet-ski facing into the breaking surf and narrowly avoiding making contact with the jagged rocks.\n\nSteph was able to grab a hold of the front end of the body board that the casualty was holding onto while Pieter gently manoeuvred the jet-ski through the breaking surf and they were able to pull the casualty out of the danger zone.\n\nThey then changed positions with Steph taking the helm of the jet-ski and Pieter was able to pull the casualty onto the jet-ski and hold him secure while they headed towards the Skuitbaai slipway.\n\nThey were able to bring the male teenager safely to Skuitbaai where additional NSRI Oyster Bay resources were at that stage arriving on the scene.\n\nNSRI Oyster Bay medics initiated medical treatment to the male teenager.\n\nPrivate Care ambulance services arrived on the scene and the boy was taken into the care of paramedics.\n\nBoth were transported to hospital by Private care ambulance in serious conditions.\n\nThe male was released from hospital later on Sunday and the female was released from hospital later on Monday.

So he ran over to the Harbour wall to try and help them, injuring his knee in the process. \n\nThere were two woman and one man in the water when he got to the Harbour wall. The man was trying to save one of the woman but was unsuccessful and had to swim back to hold on to the steps of the Harbour wall, or risk drowning himself. The woman he tried to save made it to safetey. The other woman was really struggling, her head went under the water a few times.\n\nRenaldo then decided that he had to jump into the water to save her.

He donned his rescue swimmer kit, and taking his fins and a Pink Rescue Buoy from its pole on 4th Beach ran approximately 700 meters to 1st Beach. Seeing Andrew and the child behind the sets Jason chose the most effective line to swim to get the emergency flotation to them as they were now more than 100 meters off the beach behind the backline.\n \nThe 10-year-old and 5-year-old had been assisted out of the water by bystanders whom we have not been able to identify.\n \nAndrew Alcock, wearing fins and board shorts, had swum to the eight-year-old boy, who was being pulled away from the beach in the rip. The child was slipping underwater and in severe distress. He was in a very strong rip current, being dunked under the incoming waves and hypothermia was setting in.\n \nAndrew knew that it would be too dangerous to try and swim the child back to the beach through the breaking surf and instead decided to keep him afloat behind the backline, knowing that NSRI was responding.\n \nAndrew held the child tightly. Being a Clifton resident and regular surfer and body surfer at Clifton, he is acclimatised to the cold, and using his fins, he was able to keep the child\u2019s head above water and keep him calm.\n \nAs each wave approached Andrew warned the child that they would duck under the wave, and stay under until the tailing wash dissipated before resurfacing and then face the next incoming wave with the same procedure.\n \nWith each approaching wave Andrew, who attests to the trust the child put in him, coached the child to take a deep breath and then Andrew dived him under the wave while holding onto him, preventing him from being separated in the tail wash of each wave.\n \nThe child did exceptionally well, said Andrew. He was not panicking and he kept his wits about him despite the grave danger that they found themselves facing.\n                                                                               \nAt 15h53 NSRI Bakoven Rescue Swimmer, Jason Kampel entered the water and swam out to where he thought Andrew and the child were. It took a few minutes to locate them as the waves and foam on the water made this difficult to do. Jason found them over 100 meters off the beach and used the Pink Rescue Buoy to secure and float the child as Andrew swam next to them and Gemini Legend, call sign Rescue 2 entered the bay. Andrew and the child had been in the water for almost 40 minutes.\n\nThe NSRI rescue craft arrived on the scene taking all three onboard where medical treatment for hypothermia was initiated for the child and Andrew.\n \nThey were all taken to the Bakoven rescue station where medical treatment for severe hypothermia was continued to be administered to the child and Andrew was rewarmed in the shower.\n  \nOn arrival at the Bakoven rescue Station Generic paramedics assisted our NSRI medics in continuing medical treatment to the 8-year-old child for non-fatal drowning symptoms and for severe hypothermia.\n \nOnce stabilised the child, accompanied by his family, was transported to hospital in a serious but stable condition, where he was later released by hospital staff, requiring no further medical care.\n \nThe NSRI commends Alex for staying on the call to the EOC so that information could be relayed to responders. \n\nWere it not for Andrew's rapid response with his fins, that he is acclimatised to the cold water, and that he is used to swimming in the surf at Clifton, the eight-year-old boy would not have survived.\n\nAndrew Elcock\u2019s calmness and selfless actions under difficult conditions, were exemplary, undoubtedly preventing a tragedy from occurring. The eight-year-old child, who is from Johannesburg, indeed owes his life to Andrew for his selfless actions that day. \n \nAs fellow South Africans we are proud to be able to recognise and honour this achievement.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO \/ AWARD:\nJason Kampel \n\nfor the part he played in rescuing an eight-year-old boy, shortly after 15h30 on the 30th April 2023, from a rip current off Clifton\u2019s 1st Beach. \n\nOn that day, at Clifton\u2019s 1st beach, three young children got into difficulty in a rip current; a five-year-old, an eight-year-old, and a 10-year-old.  Sea conditions were rough with 2 to 3-meter swells and a powerful rip pulling out on the Southern side of Clifton\u2019s 1st beach.\n\nFortunately Andrew and Alex Elcock, residents of Clifton, were there at the time and immediately sprang into action.  Alex immediately phoned the NSRI Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and stayed on the line, relaying critical information and updating the EOC operator, who in turn alerted NSRI Bakoven station and other emergency services.   Andrew, an experienced body surfer, ran into the surf in his boardshorts and with a pair of fins, swam out to assist the furthest boy.   \n\nNSRI rescue swimmer, Jason Kampel, was at his parents\u2019 house near Clifton\u2019s 4th Beach at the time the alert came through. He donned his rescue swimmer kit and carrying his fins, ran to the beach.  He instinctively grabbed a Pink Rescue Buoy from its pole on 4th Beach and then ran the 700 meters across to 1st Beach.  Quickly assessing the situation, seeing Andrew and the boy in the backline, and the other two children safely out the water, Jason chose the most effective line to swim the emergency flotation to them. \n\nIt took Jason a few minutes to locate Andrew and the eight-year-old boy due to the breaking waves and the seafoam.  Upon reaching them, the Pink Rescue Buoy was given to the boy as floatation and together the adults swam the boy out of the danger zone, until the NSRI rescue vessel, Gemini Legend,  arrived on the scene, taking all three onboard.  Medical treatment for hypothermia was initiated for the boy and Andrew who had been in the water for nearly 40 minutes. \n\nFurther medical attention was administered at the NSRI Bakoven rescue station and the boy, who is from Johannesburg, was transported to hospital in a serious but stable condition.  He was later released, requiring no further medical care.\n\nJason, thanks to your quick response and instinctive reaction to grab the first Pink Rescue Buoy within your reach, then efficiently swimming it out to the casualty, you helped save the life of an eight-year-old boy. \n\nWe salute you.

Photo: Toby Finneran\n\u201cAs a swimmer who does Ironman triathlons with a local South African Triathlon team called Embark, I felt confident in my abilities, even with the five to six feet swell and the strong rip current. I swam out between the two rocks, helped by the rip current, and found the lad, who was half-submerged.\n\n\u201cI gave him the buoy and spoke to him to calm him down and let him catch his breath. Then, I tried to swim with the rope of the buoy to pull him behind me. However, a big set of waves came in, and we were right in the crash zone, at risk of getting thrown onto the rocks,\u201d Finneran said.\n\nHe said panic sunk in when the buoy in the water was swept away from him.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the wave hit us, the lad was unable to hold onto the buoy and got swept closer to the rocks.\n\n\nEmergency services attending to the two individuals. Photo: Andrea Steyn\n\u201cBefore the next wave came, I quickly swam over to him, gave him the buoy, and held onto his arm as I attempted to pull him with me, trying to duck dive under the next wave, which was even bigger and had broken just before reaching us.\n\n\u201cIn the gap before the next wave, I swam sideways, trying to make sure that any waves would take us back towards the gap rather than onto the rocks.\n\n\u201cHowever, I soon realised that the strong current created by the same rip current that had gotten the lad into trouble was pushing us back out to sea. I swam sideways further and towards one of the rocks where I was able to hold on until another set of waves came that I could use to push myself along the rocks causing a few cuts and scratches,\u201d Finneran said.\n\nHe was able to get through the gap by using the rock along with a smaller set of waves that came their way.\n\n\nToby Finneran jumped into action to save the lives of two people, one in water, another on land. Photo: Toby Finneran\nOn reaching the other side of the rock, Finneran said the water was shallow right next to the deeper channel caused by the rip current and this showed how the boy could have been pulled out.\n\n\u201cWhen we got out, he (the boy) was very weak and he didn\u2019t say much. His friend was very grateful. The boy was having problems with leg cramps, arm and chest pains. I sat him down and knew someone who swallowed water could possibility suffer secondary drowning (I learnt this by watching rescue TV shows),\u201d Finneran said.\n\nHe called for a bystander to call emergency services and also called his friend in the UK, Greg Neal-Smith, an orthopaedic surgeon to get help and advice on how to assist the boy.\n\nHowever, Finneran would never have imagined he would be reacting to another emergency at the same time.\n\n\u201cAs I was focused on the lad, I suddenly noticed a figure lying motionless face down in the sand. He was about 18 years old and I think he may have tried to save the boy.\n\n\u201cMy heart raced, and I ran over, administering first aid with the help of my surgeon friend, putting the person in the recovery position and monitoring their breathing.\n\n\u201cThe bystander told me that the NSRI (National Sea Rescue Institute) was on their way, and I posted on a local travel WhatsApp group to get more help.\n\n\u201cEventually, the NSRI arrived, followed by the fire brigade and paramedics. The lad and the person I had found were both checked over, and one was treated for hypothermia and secondary drowning,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what he felt when he saw what was happening, Finneran said: \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to think. I just went. I don\u2019t feel like a hero. I think that is what you are supposed to do. If someone is in trouble you should help. It\u2019s your responsibility as a human\u201d.\n\nHowever, after the incident, Finneran reflected on the incident and said at the time he couldn\u2019t help but think about the dangers of rip currents.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a hidden danger that can quickly sweep even the strongest swimmers out to sea. I knew from experience how treacherous they can be, and I was grateful that I had been able to help the boy in time,\u201d he said.\n\nRip currents are caused by the water rushing back out to sea through a gap in a sandbar or between rocks. They can be difficult to spot, but some signs include a channel of churning, choppy water, a difference in water colour, a line of seaweed, or a gap in the incoming waves.\n\nAccording to the NSRI, spring tide peaked on Friday, May 5, and warned bathers and sea users to be cautious during the Spring Tides higher than normal high tides and lower than normal low tides.\n\nThere are two high tides and two low tides daily and times are slighter later on each following day.\n\n\u201cSpring tides are known to cause stronger than normal rip currents and risks are normally increased at the tide change when the high tide peak recedes towards low tide.\n\n\u201cBathers, paddlers, sailors, shoreline anglers, recreational and commercial boaters are urged to have safety top of mind.\n\n\u201cWe are also appealing to parents to ensure that children have responsible adult supervision in and around water \u2013 at coastal waters, at inland waters, swimming pools, or any body of water,\u201d the NSRI said.\n\nIt is also important to note that once caught in a rip current, stay calm, do not swim against the current, rather swim parallel to the shore. If you cannot swim out of the current, try to float or tread water and signal for help.\n\n\u201cAs I watched the emergency services attend to the boy and the person I had found on the beach, I hoped that others would learn from this experience and take the necessary precautions to stay safe in the water. Rip currents are a powerful force, but with knowledge and awareness, we can avoid the dangers they pose.\n\n\u201cMore awareness surrounding rip currents should be shared. I have heard of many drownings at beaches in Cape Town and think they should have a notice to say how many drownings have taken place at a particular beach.\n\n\u201cAlso, have a notice with imagery of where the rip currents are so there is more awareness to bathers when visiting. The notices should be clear, educational and more in-depth and visual,\u201d Finneran added.\n\nIn an emergency contact the NSRI at 087 094 9774.\n\nrobin.francke@inl.co.za","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":null,"Link ":"https:\/\/www.iol.co.za\/news\/feel-good\/i-didnt-have-time-to-think-i-just-went-says-uk-tourist-who-saved-the-lives-of-two-people-in-cape-town-29f97c58-46fb-41e2-be54-58daa354cc93","Rescuer Details":"Toby Finneran","Name of Rescuer with NSRI\/Lifeguarding experience":null,"Capacity":null,"Rescued details":"Unknown","Black":null,"White":null,"Coloured":null,"Indian":null,"Foreign":null,"Unknown":1.0,"Unnamed: 31":null,"Unnamed: 32":null,"Unnamed: 33":null,"Unnamed: 34":null,"Unnamed: 35":null,"Unnamed: 36":null,"Unnamed: 37":null,"Unnamed: 38":null,"Unnamed: 39":null},{"Unnamed: 1":2023,"Date":"2023-06-28T00:00:00.000","Month":"Jun","Number of people assisted":1.0,"Adult":1.0,"Child":null,"Female":1.0,"Male":null,"Number of Victims who needed PRB":1.0,"Number of rescuers who needed PRB":null,"# of  Persons in trouble -  Pink buoy deployed but not used ":null,"Max number of persons floated":null,"PRB location number":"NZ","Place":"Napier, New Zealand","City":"New Zealand","Sponsor":null,"Rescue ":"A Pink Rescue Buoy has been used to help save a 19-year-old woman at Napier\u2019s Marine Parade beachfront in New Zealand - the first rescue that they are aware of.

Her dad, age 36, had gone into the water to try to assist assist and both of them were in grave distress caught in rip currents. They are both from Sandton, Johannesburg.\n\nNSRI Mossel Bay had also been alerted and NSRI Mossel Bay rescue swimmers, nearer to the scene at the time, had responded.\n\nOur NSRI Wilderness rescue vehicle towed the NSRI rescue craft XXX to be launched on the scene. \n\nNSRI EOC (Emergency Operations Center), at the NSRI EOC control room in Milnerton, Cape Town, used the beach safety camera to relay updated information to the responding resources.\n\nHartenbos Lifesaving lifeguard Ian Barnard, 18, had reached the beach first. He grabbed an NSRI pink rescue buoy, that is stationed at the beach, and he swam out reaching the 2 casualties and he handed them the pink buoy to aid them to stay afloat while he attempted to calm them and prevent panic.\n\nIan admits that the dad had desperately tried to climb onto him while the girl used the pink buoy to stay afloat.\n\nRealising the grave danger they were all facing in the strong rip currents, Ian had no choice but to retreat away from them knowing that with only the one pink rescue buoy amongst them - when Ian retreated the dad would have no choice but to use the pink buoy, with his daughter, for both of them to stay afloat until additional help arrived. \n\nIan swam back to the beach where a bystander handed him a second pink rescue buoy (that is also stationed at that beach) and Ian ran along rocks to re-enter the water nearer to the casualties.\n\nBy this stage Good Samaritans Steven Steyn, 19, a local surfer, and Corne Calitz, 26, a local surfer and former lifeguard, had entered the water with their surfboards.\n\nThey reached the casualties and used their surfboards to aid the dad and daughter to stay afloat. They considered paddling further out to sea to wait on NSRI rescue craft but decided to rather attempt to get back towards the shore.\n\nOn arriving on the scene Adam Helling, an NSRI Wilderness rescue swimmer (who is also an NSRI Table Bay rescue swimmer and an NSRI lifeguard) launched into the water with his personal torpedo rescue buoy.\n\nBy this stage the first pink rescue buoy had been abandoned by the casualties who were now using the surfboards of Steven and Corne to stay afloat with Steven and Corne helping them.\n\nIan, with the second pink rescue buoy, and Adam, with his personal rescue buoy, were helping Steven and Corne, with their surfboards, to get the 2 casualties to shore.\n\nGood Samaritan, Tristan van Wyk, 20, from George, had entered the water and as the 4 rescuers reached the shallows he had also assisted to aid the 2 casualties from the water.\n\nBy this stage additional NSRI and emergency services were arriving on the scene.\n\nThe 2 casualties were medically treated on the beach for non-fatal drowning symptoms and exhaustion.\n\nThey were stabilised by paramedics and transported to hospital by ER24 ambulance in stable conditions for further care and they are both expected to fully recover.\n\nThe mom, who was on the beach during this incident, accompanied her family to hospital.\n\nNSRI commend the swift reactions of Ian, Steven, Corne, Adam and Tristan, who all contributed to lives being saved.\n\nThis incident has again highlighted the importance of the NSRI Pink Rescue Buoy program, launched in 2017, that has contributed to 160 lives saved (that we know of). All in water rescues have been successful and no harm has come to any of the rescuers who have used an NSRI pink rescue buoy to help someone in danger of drowning.\n\nNSRI URGENT SAFETY ALERT:\n\nAt least 7 drowning accidents, where it is believed 4 were fatal, along the KZN South Coast this past weekend, along the coast and at an inland river, and a fatal drowning accident at Witbank Dam this past Saturday, has emphasised the urgency in an appeal by NSRI, lifeguards, the emergency services and Police, to adopt a safety conscious mind-set in and around water.\n\nLETS KEEP EACH OTHER SAFE\n\nWe are appealing to everyone to adopt safety in all activities this summer season.\n\nBathers at beaches should only swim where and when lifeguards are on duty - swim at the safer swimming zone lifeguards post at our beaches - obey the lifeguards for you and your family's safety\n\nBeach bathers, shoreline anglers, and coastal hikers at the coast be aware of 2 high tides and 2 low tides around the coast every day - be aware of rip currents that suck bathers out to sea. \n\nDuring the full moon phase and during new moon phase there is a phenomenon called a SPRING TIDE that brings higher than normal high tides and lower than normal low tides that can cause stronger than normal rip currents \n\nInland bathers at rivers, lakes, dams and swimming pools - only swim with a floating object for safety and be safe - don\u2019t venture in too deep and don\u2019t get out of your depth - if you get into trouble in any coastal or at any inland waterway simply stay afloat and don\u2019t panic - use the air in your lungs for floatation and tread water moving your arms and legs in circular movements.\n\nParents, always ensure responsible sober adults supervise children while they are swimming\n\nBoaters, paddlers, surfers and sailors - download and always use the NSRI SafeTrx smartphone App when out on the water - carry and know how to use your safety equipment - a referee whistle, red distress flares, cell phone fully charged in a water-tight plastic sleeve - have safety top of mind always and let\u2019s all see the new years and 2024 through safely on our South African waters \n\nLETS KEEP EACH OTHER SAFE. \n-ENDS- \n \n \nNSRI EMERGENCY: 087 094 9774\n\nRELEASED BY \n\n\n \nCraig Lambinon\nNSRI COMMUNICATIONS\nEmail: communications@searescue.org.za | Cell: +27 (0) 82 380 3800 | nsri.org.za","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":null,"Link ":null,"Rescuer Details":"3 rescuers:\nTristan van Wyk, 20, from George 0793831324\nIan 0793733129 (rescued with pink buoy)= Hartenbos Lifesaving lifeguard Ian Barnard, 18\nSteven Steyn, 19, a local surfer, and Corne Calitz, 26, a local surfer and former lifeguard\nAdam Helling, an NSRI Wilderness rescue swimmer (who is also an NSRI Table Bay rescue swimmer and an NSRI lifeguard) \nAnother surfer assisted with rescue, rescued daughter ","Name of Rescuer with NSRI\/Lifeguarding experience":"Ian Barnard","Capacity":"Lifeguard","Rescued details":"Daughter Sitabogo 11\nFather Ntakadzeni Tharage 36\nBoth from Sandton\nMother Sharon 0714945098","Black":2,"White":null,"Coloured":null,"Indian":null,"Foreign":null,"Unknown":null,"Unnamed: 31":null,"Unnamed: 32":null,"Unnamed: 33":null,"Unnamed: 34":null,"Unnamed: 35":null,"Unnamed: 36":null,"Unnamed: 37":null,"Unnamed: 38":null,"Unnamed: 39":null},{"Unnamed: 1":2023,"Date":null,"Month":null,"Number of people assisted":null,"Adult":null,"Child":null,"Female":null,"Male":null,"Number of Victims who needed PRB":null,"Number of rescuers who needed PRB":null,"# of  Persons in trouble -

The girl frantically appealed to Janine and Natalie for help.\n \nNatalie grabbed her body board and launched into the water to go to assist (Natalie grew up in Johannesburg and at school in Potchefstroom she had achieved swimming Provincial colors). So she did not hesitate to go to help while Janine called NSRI.\n \nA bystander calmed the boy and prevented him from re-entering the water realising that he was exhausted.\n \nDuvan van Breda, 28, of Duvan Fishing Charters, on the beach at his wind shield, with French fishing tourists on a shoreline angling fishing charter, was alerted by bystanders who came running up to him shouting for help.\n \nDuvan and his videographer, Gustav Schlechter, reacted swiftly and they both launched into the water to assist.\n \nDuvan told NSRI he witnessed 3 people in the water, a dad and his wife, from Jeffreys Bay, and a family member, who we believe is from Pretoria, she was in her jeans, and all 3 of them were in grave distress and in grave danger and obviously caught in strong rip currents.\n \nDuvan noticed 3 NSRI pink buoys were floating in the vicinity.\n \nDuvan admits that lifeguard training he undertook when he was at school kicked in and his videographer, Gustav, happens to be a South African champion swimmer.\n \nThey did not hesitate to go in and help.\n \nDuvan reached a female, (now believed to be the Aunt of the 13 year old - she was holding onto an NSRI pink rescue buoy that was aiding her to stay afloat).\n \nDuvan was able to coral her towards a shallower sand bank where she was able to stand. There he managed to calm her. Then he managed to get her to shore safely.\n \nGustav had reached the female (the mom of the 13 year old).\n \nDuvan had returned into the surf and he reached the dad and encouraged him to tread water while holding onto the body board - but he was getting very tired, said Duvan.\n \nThen Good Samaritan Natalie Rhodes arrived with her body board at the dad and Duvan. The dad used her body board to stay afloat.\n \nNatalie has told NSRI that when she reached the man he held onto the body board and she climbed off and held onto the one side of the board \u2013 they were both using the board to stay afloat.\n \nDuring this time Gustav was helping the female (the mom) towards the shore but the rip currents hampered their efforts. Eventually Gustav reached the shore with the lady (the Aunt) and she was taken into the care of bystanders.\n \nGustav returned into the water and arrived at Duvan, the girl Good Samaritan and the dad.\n \nAn unidentified person, armed with a pink rescue buoy, arrived at them which Natalie held onto giving the dad exclusive use of the body board for floatation.  \n \nThe unidentified person assisted in encouraging them to swim away from the rip current.\n \nTogether they floated out there for about 20 minutes, all the while with Duvan and the unidentified man gently coaxing them and corralling them to try to escape the rip current, and they all eventually managed to reach the shore.\n \nBy the time they were all on the beach NSRI and rescue services were arriving on the beach.\n \nThe mom and her husband were transported to hospital in serious but stable conditions, by Gardmed ambulance, where they are recovering in the care of doctors and nurses.\n \nEveryone involved, including all bystanders, are commended for saving 3 lives.\n \nThe pink rescue buoys and the body board, used for floatation, have been hailed as essential in this rescue, by the Good Samaritans and the casualties.","Location\/ Cause of Drowning":"Rip Current","Additional ":null,"Link ":"https:\/\/www.nsri.org.za\/2023\/11\/multiple-lives-saved-this-past-weekend\/","Rescuer Details":"Natalie Rhodes (gave bodyboard to the dad; later used the pink buoy herself)\nDuvan van Breda (rescued the aunt with PRB)\nGustav Schlechter","Name of Rescuer with NSRI\/Lifeguarding experience":null,"Capacity":null,"Rescued details":"Aunt from Pretoria rescued with PRB.
